    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>As its name indicates, an operating system (OS) kernel is the core software of operating systems. Like other
      software, compilers are critical in the development of OS kernels. A recent study shows that compiler bugs can
      silently introduce bugs into their compiled code. Although compiler bugs are critical in the development of OS
      kernels, most studies on compiler bugs analyze the characteristics of only compiler bugs. Their findings are less
      interesting to outsiders, e.g. the OS community. Although two recent papers have started to analyze how compiler
      bugs affect the development of other projects, no study has been conducted to explore how such bugs affect OS
      kernels. As a result, many questions are still open. For instance, in the development of OS kernels, are most
      compiler bugs identified by OS programmers themselves? When bypassing compiler bugs, what is the relationship
      between compiler-bug symptoms and modified OS components? The answers to the above questions are useful for both
      compiler and OS programmers.</p>
    <p>To answer the above questions, we conducted the first empirical study on how compiler bugs affect OS kernels. We
      collected 494 workarounds of compiler bugs from the revision histories of 7 popular OS kernels. We analyze these
      workarounds and explore the answers to four research questions. We summarized our answers into 9 interesting
      findings. For instance, we found that in most workarounds, compiler bugs are not reported by OS programmers. As
      another example, we find that the libraries and make files of OS kernels are the most affected per code line.
      Furthermore, we provide our interpretations of our findings for programmers and researchers.</p>

    <h2>Research Questions & Results</h2>
    <details>
      <summary><strong>RQ1: Who reports the compiler bugs?</strong></summary>
      <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Compare identities of OS workaround authors and compiler bug reporters to study
        knowledge flow direction.</p>
      <p><strong>Results:</strong> In 61.9% of cases, the workaround author and bug reporter are different. OS
        programmers usually read compiler bug reports instead of reporting them.</p>

      <p><strong>Findings:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Finding 1:</strong> In 61.9% of the links, compiler bugs are not reported by programmers of OS
          workarounds.</li>
        <li><strong>Finding 2:</strong> Compared with other programmers, OS kernel programmers care more about
          wrong-code and optimization compiler bugs.</li>
      </ul>

      <summary><strong>RQ2: How long does it take from reporting bug reports to implementing their workarounds?</strong>
      </summary>
      <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Measure time delay between bug reporting and patching.</p>
      <p><strong>Results:</strong> If OS programmers are not the bug reporters, the delay is ~10x longer.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Finding 3:</strong> When compiler bugs are not reported by OS programmers, it takes 10 times as many
          days to identify and bypass them.</li>
        <li><strong>Finding 4:</strong> The time intervals between reporting compiler bugs and bypassing them in OS
          kernels are shorter when the symptoms are crashes, optimizations, and wrong-code bugs.</li>

      <summary><strong>RQ3: How similar are the code samples from bug reports and the real code from OS
          workarounds?</strong></summary>
      <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Analyze the similarity between code samples in compiler bug reports and real modified
        code in OS kernel workarounds.</p>
      <p><strong>Method:</strong> We use <code>JPlag</code> with Greedy String Tiling algorithm to compare 239 (bug
        sample, OS file) pairs.</p>

      <p><strong>Findings:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Finding 5:</strong> Except for a few cases, the code samples of bug reports are dissimilar to OS
          kernel code.</li>
        <li><strong>Finding 6:</strong> The code samples of wrong-code bugs are more different from the modified files
          of OS kernels than compiler bugs with other symptoms.</li>
      </ul>

      <summary><strong>RQ4: What is the relationship between compiler-bug symptoms, modified OS components, and modified
          lines of workarounds?</strong>
      </summary>
      <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Understand how different compiler bug symptoms affect various OS kernel components, and
        how much code is typically modified in workarounds.</p>
      <p><strong>Method:</strong> We group 494 workaround commits by OS component (e.g., library, driver, makefile) and
        analyze LOC changes using GitHub diff stats.</p>

      <p><strong>Findings:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Finding 7:</strong> Although compiler bugs tend to affect larger components, the library and the
          Makefile are the most affected per code line.</li>
        <li><strong>Finding 8:</strong> The workarounds on the development, the library, and the kernel core have more
          modifications, and some modifications are repetitive.</li>
        <li><strong>Finding 9:</strong> The library and the development are affected by more symptoms, and bypassing
          crashes and wrong code requires more modifications.</li>
      </ul>
