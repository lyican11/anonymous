    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>As its name indicates, an operating system (OS) kernel is the core software of operating systems. Like other
      software, compilers are critical in the development of OS kernels. A recent study shows that compiler bugs can
      silently introduce bugs into their compiled code. Although compiler bugs are critical in the development of OS
      kernels, most studies on compiler bugs analyze the characteristics of only compiler bugs. Their findings are less
      interesting to outsiders, e.g. the OS community. Although two recent papers have started to analyze how compiler
      bugs affect the development of other projects, no study has been conducted to explore how such bugs affect OS
      kernels. As a result, many questions are still open. For instance, in the development of OS kernels, are most
      compiler bugs identified by OS programmers themselves? When bypassing compiler bugs, what is the relationship
      between compiler-bug symptoms and modified OS components? The answers to the above questions are useful for both
      compiler and OS programmers.</p>
    <p>To answer the above questions, we conducted the first empirical study on how compiler bugs affect OS kernels. We
      collected 494 workarounds of compiler bugs from the revision histories of 7 popular OS kernels. We analyze these
      workarounds and explore the answers to four research questions. We summarized our answers into 9 interesting
      findings. For instance, we found that in most workarounds, compiler bugs are not reported by OS programmers. As
      another example, we find that the libraries and make files of OS kernels are the most affected per code line.
      Furthermore, we provide our interpretations of our findings for programmers and researchers.</p>

    <h2>Research Questions , Tools & Dataset</h2>
    <details>
      <summary><strong>RQ1: Who reports the compiler bugs?</strong></summary>
      <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Compare OS workaround authors and compiler bug reporters to study knowledge flow
        direction.</p>
      <p><strong>Findings:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Finding 1:</strong> In 61.9% of the links, compiler bugs are not reported by programmers of OS
          workarounds.</li>
        <li><strong>Finding 2:</strong> Compared with other programmers, OS kernel programmers care more about
          wrong-code and optimization compiler bugs.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Tool:</strong></p>
      <p>
        We provide an automated tool to extract information (e.g. author, date) of OS commits and compiler bugs that
        mentioned by these commits. Given a commit related to compiler bugs dataset extracted by GitHub API and keyword
        search(imported via SQL), the tool performs:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Extraction of OS commit information and compiler bug URLs from commit comments via regular expressions</li>
        <li>Retrieval of bug report information (reporter, report date, keyword) via crawler</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The tool is reusable and supports any OS kernel commit dataset with minimal configuration. Output is a CSV
        containing matched records, suitable for further quantitative analysis.
      </p>
      <p>
        After generating the csv file, we also manually extracted and supplemented the data that was not correctly
        extracted from the error log. Meanwhile, the datasets of RQ1 and RQ2 are further filtered from the generated csv
        files (more_info.csv) for the research of this issue. The original generated file of the tool will be displayed
        later
      </p>


      <p><strong>Dataset:</strong></p>
      <p>
        The dataset for RQ1 (<code>RQ1.xlsx</code>) includes 530 links of OS kernel commits and their
        associated compiler bug reports. Key columns include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Commit Author</strong> - extracted from OS kernel Git repositories</li>
        <li><strong>Reported By</strong> - extracted from compiler bug report</li>
        <li><strong>Same</strong> - 1 if commit author and bug reporter are the same, 2 otherwise</li>
        <li><strong>Symptom</strong> - categorized based on bug report and taxonomy from prior work</li>
      </ul>

      <summary><strong>RQ2: How long does it take from reporting bug reports to implementing their workarounds?</strong>
      </summary>
      <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Measure time interval from bug report to workarounds.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Finding 3:</strong> When compiler bugs are not reported by OS programmers, it takes 10 times as many
          days to identify and bypass them.</li>
        <li><strong>Finding 4:</strong> The time intervals between reporting compiler bugs and bypassing them in OS
          kernels are shorter when the symptoms are crashes, optimizations, and wrong-code bugs.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Tool:</strong></p>
      The information needed in RQ2 is also extracted by the tool in RQ1.

      <p><strong>Dataset:</strong></p>
      <p>
        The dataset for RQ2 (<code>RQ2.xlsx</code>) includes 530 links of OS kernel commits and their
        associated compiler bug reports. Key columns include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>CommitDate</strong> - extracted from OS kernel Git repositories</li>
        <li><strong>ReportDate</strong> - extracted from compiler bug report</li>
        <li><strong>Time interval</strong> - calculated by subtracting the report date from the commit date</li>
        <li><strong>Symptom</strong> - categorized based on bug report and taxonomy from prior work</li>

      <summary><strong>RQ3: How similar are the code samples from bug reports and the real code from OS
          workarounds?</strong></summary>

      <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Analyze the similarity between code samples in compiler bug reports and real modified
        code in OS kernel workarounds.</p>

      <p><strong>Findings:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Finding 5:</strong> Except for a few cases, the code samples of bug reports are dissimilar to OS
          kernel code.</li>
        <li><strong>Finding 6:</strong> The code samples of wrong-code bugs are more different from the modified files
          of OS kernels than compiler bugs with other symptoms.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Tool:</strong></p>
      <p>We use <code>JPlag</code> to calculate the similarity between bug code samples and OS code files. The result is
        generated as an HTML report.</p>
      <p>Example usage (assuming the <code>gcc12345/</code> folder contains the bug sample and OS code files):</p>
      <pre><code>java -jar jplag-6.0.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar -l c --overwrite -t 6 gcc12345</code></pre>

      <p><strong>Dataset:</strong></p>
      <p>
        The dataset for RQ3 (<code>RQ3.xlsx</code>) includes 239 calculated similarity results between bug code samples
        and OS code. Key columns include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Maximal</strong> - Maximal similarity calculated by JPlag. "none" indicates that the number of
          tokens
          does not meet the calculation requirement, and "out" indicates it exceeds the calculation range.</li>
        <li><strong>file</strong> - Source code file in the OS kernel for similarity comparison</li>
        <li><strong>Symptom</strong> - Bug symptom category based on prior taxonomy</li>
      </ul>

      <summary><strong>RQ4: What is the relationship between compiler-bug symptoms, modified OS components, and modified
          lines of workarounds?</strong>
      </summary>
      <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Understand how different compiler bug symptoms affect various OS kernel components, and
        how much code is typically modified in workarounds.</p>
      <p><strong>Findings:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Finding 7:</strong> Although compiler bugs tend to affect larger components, the library and the
          Makefile are the most affected per code line.</li>
        <li><strong>Finding 8:</strong> The workarounds on the development, the library, and the kernel core have more
          modifications, and some modifications are repetitive.</li>
        <li><strong>Finding 9:</strong> The library and the development are affected by more symptoms, and bypassing
          crashes and wrong code requires more modifications.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Tool:</strong></p>
      <p>We use <code>RQ4_input.xlsx</code> as the input of our tool, which include the OS name, commit ID, affected
        component and symptom of compiler bugs that mentioned by the OS commit.
        Then we use GitHub API to extract the add, delete and total modification of commits through OS name and commit
        IDs.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Dataset:</strong></p>
      <p>
        The result dataset for RQ4 (<code>RQ4_result.xlsx</code>) includes 530 links of OS kernel commits and their
        associated compiler bug reports. Key columns include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>component</strong> - affected OS component by compiler bugs(checked manually through the taxonomy
          built in our paper)</li>
        <li><strong>add</strong> - added lines of code in OS commits</li>
        <li><strong>delete</strong> - delted lines of code in OS commits</li>
        <li><strong>total</strong> - total modified lines of code in OS commits</li>
      </ul>
